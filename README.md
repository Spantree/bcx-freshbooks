# Basecamp Next <-> Freshbooks Sync

*This is a work in progress* with the goal of linking our basecamp next projects to freshbooks for time tracking and invoicing.

## Setup

Add a `bcx.properties` file to your user home folder with your basecamp credentials.

`
bcx.username=yourusername
bcx.password=yourpassword
`

This app will eventually be updated to support OAuth.
